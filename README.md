using_8085_processor_for_something
==================================

Project to try to figure out and do something with an Intel P8085 processor that I salvaged.

I found an Intel P8085 among my pile of salvaged ICs and want to learn how to use it. This project will be for me to do something or multiple things with this retro 8-bit processor. I don't have any latch ICs on hand, but have some SRAM chips, maybe I could try to rig something up. Mostly likely, I'll try to do one of those "2 chip computer" setups, paring this retro CPU with a Microcontroller which emulates other hardware such as RAM,ROM, etc.
