using_8085_processor_for_something
==================================

Project to try to figure out and do something with an Intel P8085 processor that I salvaged.

I found an Intel P8085 among my pile of salvaged ICs and want to learn how to use it. This project will be for me to do something or multiple things with this retro 8-bit processor. I don't have any latch ICs on hand, but have built the equivalent of one using 7400 series Logic chips and will try to test it with some SRAM. Hopefully I will have a functional little computer system using this microprocessor at some point and learn many new things (get better at assembly programming, have a deeper understanding of the low-level details of a computer, etc.).
